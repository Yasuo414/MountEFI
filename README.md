# MountEFI
Hello, user,
I see that you downloaded my program (.cmd script),
which will mount the partition on which the Windows boot loader is installed.

One caveat!!!! If you damage your PC it's not my fault because you used it and not me.
This program should be used by bootloader developers and not by regular PC users, because if they delete the wrong folder,
they're screwed because Windows won't turn on anymore.
